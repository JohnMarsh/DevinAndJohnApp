    Project Description:
    --------------------
    We are planning on building a social network.  This social network acts as a place for people to see what other
    people on the internet think of things.  Through pre-configured and user submitted objects (which include everything
    from things in real life to websites), users are able to "like" or "dislike" them.  Once users start "liking and 
    "disliking" objects, the application then shows the difference of "likes" to "dislikes".  Other features of the network
    will include things such as "following" users likes and dislikes and the ability to give reviews on top of your like
    and dislike.  All content and user information will be stored in a database.  The web server makes requests to the
    server for getting and setting specific things and then sends this information to the client side Javascript to display.
    We plan to allow users to log in through Facebook which allows us to post interactions on our website to Facebook.
